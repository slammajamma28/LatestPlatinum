    <!--<h3>Store Description</h3>
    <p>

        forma.8 is a unique take on the proven Metroidvania action-adventure formula, with a striking visual style and a huge world to explore.

        As the small exploration probe forma.8 you're stranded alone on the surface of an alien planet. Separated from your companions by accident you have a life or death mission to accomplish: find and recover a lost, powerful energy source before it's too late. Ancient civilisations, great perils and dystopian visions await you. And not everything is what it seems...

        - Explore a huge, open world full of secrets
        - Solve ancient mysteries
        - Gain new power-ups to progress in your adventure
        - Fight deadly enemies and face powerful bosses
        - Delve into a deep and cryptic lore
        - Beautifully hand-drawn vector graphics, presented in silky smooth 60fps

    <h3>My Review</h3>
    <p>
        I played this on my Vita. Not the best metroidvania I've ever played.
